## Submission Instructions

### Overview
One of our group members works part time at a local independently-owned
coffee shop, and she mentioned that their current inventory system has
a vast amount of room for improvement. Our goal is to automate as much 
of their ordering as possible by building in logic that will trigger push 
notifications of reminders to re-order items any time that the inventory
is updated. 
### Features
- User authentication (and potentially authorization - re: owner and employee
level accounts)
- CRUD inventory system linked to API
- Search/view results
- Push notifications to remind to reorder (potentially send a cart that is
pre-populated with items/quantities to be ordered)
### Technologies
- JavaScript
- AngularJS
- API for inventory items
- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL/other database
### What I'll Have to Learn
- How to connect Spring Boot and AngularJS
- How to use data from API alongside user input information 
- Responsive web-design
- How to create push notifications
